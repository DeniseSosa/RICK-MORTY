           Hello everybody! My name is Denise Sosa. I'm 29 years old and I am from a little town called Plaza Huincul
           in the province of Neuqu√©n, Argentina.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've always loved learning languages but never thought about programming until 2023.
          All started when I said goodbye to my position as a hotel receptionist,
          and bravely embarking on the journey to embrace the challenge of becoming a full-stack developer.
        </p>
        <p>
           The path was tough, but one of my strengths is dedication and curiosity, which helped me a lot to develop my knowledge.
           A key aspect of my success lies in my ability to truly listen,
           empathizing with clients and understanding their unique needs.            
        </p>
        <p>
           During my leisure time, I enjoy hiking and walking through breathtaking landscapes. I usually visit little towns in southern Patagonia to camp there.
           There's nothing like fresh air to clear one's mind!!!
